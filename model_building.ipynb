nice but let s go okay so this is unexpected well i know you like margarita so my first thought wa a mexican restaurant good thought but i assumed other men had come to that same conclusion they have which led me to polynesian fare i like to think of the mai tai a the margarita of the south pacific you don t do anything on a whim do you did once didn t like it i have an idea for a i star trek i episode i d like to present to you why me because i m hoping to sell it and since it s going to be broadcast television i want to make sure the common man can understand it well i understand i wa just insulted excellent i came to the right common man we start on a gas giant in the vicinity of rigel iv then see a shuttle craft a dot of silver against the inky blackness of space inside the shuttle craft we see lieutenant worf struggling to breathe he s been infected by a vicious intelligent fungus where are you going i m listening cough cough worf is choking on spore but not just your everyday spore these are spore with their own evil agenda uh huh and a he sink into a coma a mysterious figure in a spacesuit approach he lower the visor of his helmet revealing future worf are you hooked oh yeah main title cue theme song and the soothing voice of patrick stewart a captain picard say space the final frontier who s patrick stewart feeling better i m fine just having a little moment earlier oh yeah all right mm mmm seems like running into pastor rob kind of kind of rattled you a little bit oh well i wa asked to leave the church and he s still there so it s still a little fresh mm yeah i get that seems like a nice guy though oh yeah he s great cute a a button i guess i prefer a bigger man like george oh yeah bigger the better deep within the i enterprise s i control room future worf say i willingly sacrifice myself for the good of this mission then throw himself into the warp core there s an explosion of tachyons the i enterprise i blast free of the gigantic field of fungus fade out written by sheldon lee cooper what do you think if this worf fella wa infected on the shuttle why would he come back to the i enterprise i and put everyone else in danger well i my father found a flaw in my story i i my sister had a job i envied i i it wa a big day for the common man i i but then i had an idea that i i like future worf wa ahead of it time i i missy i what why is a dollar worth a dollar sheldon i m busy me too i ve solved all of our money problem i m going to invent my own digital currency like printing your own no first we assign value to difficult to find number and store them in a computer database then we create an algorithm to mine the number then we encourage people to switch from currency that are government backed to ours it s brilliant i m going to be rich speaking of did you know batman is also secretly a rich dude or he life in a rich dude s basement i m still figuring it out oh thank you tiki woman so what s going on at work i don t want to bore you

you need money to make money no well it s a phrase and my clever twist on it is i m going to make money to make money mm hmm now when i say make money you might think that i m talking about counterfeiting but no i m talking about creating a unique decentralized digital currency that people can pay to own sound like a scam no it s an open source currency that ha value due to mathematical scarcity sound pretty scammy you don t understand i do you say a bunch of fancy jibber jabber people don t want to admit they re too stupid to understand then they give you their money well um sort of love it how do we get started well all we need is a mainframe computer how much is that new about half a million dollar but i m hoping to find something slightly used time will prove me right you re not gonna believe this but i don t go on a lot of date no it s true sure i did okay a a younger man but there wa a war on and most of the able bodied men were elsewhere so you sowed some oat i get it

you sneaking up on me i whistled didn t you hear me whistle it s our code right code we shouldn t need code we should be getting married planning our honeymoon not running for our life we re not running for our life we re just we re buying time okay until we can figure out how to stop a superhuman assassin yeah that we ve been on the run for three day and somehow he keep finding u it s not looking good well he hasn t gotten u yet ha he yeah because he jumped through a stained glass window and landed like a cat mm hm i can do that too he ha superhuman strength well i have super beast strength bullet can t even stop him he s got me there this isn t a joke vincent we re not moving forward we re moving backward we re living in the shadow just like you used to yes until you rescued me right yeah but now we have to rescue each other whoever is behind these experiment know who we are now that doesn t just put u in danger it put everyone we care about in danger too which mean he s not gonna stop coming after u until he succeeds which is why we gotta put our focus back on whoever sent the guy okay cut the head off the snake stop them before they stop u so we can finally get married that s if you still want to get married no of course i want to get married i love you vincent you know that it s just sometimes i wonder if it s ever really gonna happen hamlin this is detective hamlin please don t touch my thing that includes my gummy worm forbes hey uh can you talk can you believe this guy you on a burner phone yeah yeah i am what s going on any problem no i like having roommate again it s so not private i protective custody suck i i m sorry j t we just can t take any chance not for you te heather i know i know but i don t have to like it do i this is not the cop i want to be sleeping with if you know what i mean okay well a soon a we find out who s behind these experiment the sooner we can get on with our life any progress i ran genome sequencing on some of the outbreak victim the one that were enhanced by the parasite okay and i i identified i trace amount of methyl aldehyde in the delivery system aka formaldehyde okay i don t understand how doe that help distribution is highly regulated so not many lab are gonna have it so if we can find the lab we can figure out who s behind this yeah someone s gotta be making these highly complex serum right i how many lab j t i uh around two hundred are you kidding me man you gotta narrow it down hey give me a break don t you think i m trying i don t have the processing capacity to do it here and i can t very well sneak off to the university towing bodyguard okay i m sorry man i m just i m frustrated and i m hungry and i m cold it s okay i understand wait wait doesn t the hospital have supercomputer yeah they do but how are you gonna get in without somebody noticing i especially the guy who s trying to kill you i we gotta get out of here come on hello vincent i you there i i vincent i hello vincent what have we got chemical accident third degree burn or s prepped and waiting what on whose order dr keller s oh keller okay fifth floor thank you fifth floor gentleman clear all right i owe you guy thanks no way you saved my son doc you guy gonna be all right yeah we ll be okay all right take it easy guy let s go okay okay hopefully i can access the mainframe from here cross it over to j t off site so he can narrow down the list of lab okay i found a candy bar and an apple living the dream i ll take the apple oh okay here any uh clean clothes in there yeah scrub blue and hibiscus pink no wedding dress or tux by chance no sorry you know j t wa right i mean there are so many lab this is gonna take day to narrow down yeah we don t have day neither do our friend and family te can t protect them forever so what are you suggesting i m suggesting that we stop running that we leave town i hate to break it to you but the assassin will keep following u right and if we draw him out at least everyone else will be safe and give j t time to narrow down this list and figure out who s behind it all actually i m thinking that we can figure out who s behind this ourselves by leaving town by controlling the situation yes think about it we ve been on the defensive ever since his first attack and it isn t working we have gotta turn the table go on the offense control where and when the next attack happens surprise him for once catherine we re gonna need a pretty good reason to leave town otherwise he s gonna think it s a trap yeah well maybe we should elope you gotta be kidding me no not actually elope obviously just make him think that we are we re barely one step ahead of him a it is he s gonna believe that we re just taking off to elope because he know how desperate we are he first attacked u in a church maybe he think we re desperate to get married before he kill u look i don t know i m just i m tired and i m hung all screaming growl don t someone might see you alarm ringing woman i all personnel we have a code silver i i code silver all hospital personnel i come on we gotta stop him that s it we re definitely eloping vincent well no sign of him yet don t forget to bring two form of id for the marriage license right come on are you really serious about going through with this do you have a better idea than luring him out of town no but eloping okay it s just a ruse vincent it s a reason for u to get out of town so he doesn t think it s a trap unless he think that s exactly what it is but if he doe he s still gonna follow u and we can control the where and the when okay but what if we actually have to go through with this before he attack u then we do don t forget a tie we need to make it look legit okay wait a minute are you are you completely okay with this relax i already told you yeah okay i know it s a ruse but it also sound like you re okay with it if it s not okay i don t know if you re aware of this vincent but there is a superhuman assassin after u can we talk about this later no no we can t okay i don t want to elope i want to get married the right way the way we deserve in front of friend and family but we can t invite our friend and family that s the whole point of u going to niagara fall to protect them i m not talking about the plan i am talking about our wedding or at least the wedding that i thought we would have vincent it is just a ruse okay yes but would you or wouldn t you be okay if it wasn t i don t know maybe vincent all i know is that i love you and i want to be your wife and the sooner the better don t you want that too yes of course it is okay but okay the only way to do that is for u to get our life back first what are we gonna tell your sister or j t or te for that matter we are not going to tell them anything we can t for their own safety especially te she s already risked too much trying to get everybody police protection i don t want her to get hurt helping u okay okay i think we ve got everything are we doing this thing or not i guess vincent keller i love you and i don t need a piece of paper to prove it but the bad guy might all right let u go and get our happily ever after back the chief s still holding all right tell him i m in a meeting that s what i told him last time well what are you doing here oh hey sorry i i need a minute but the chief sound really upset captain i think he want to i know what he want i ll call back if you re interested he want to know why i authorized the extra police protection he want to know what it s for but i can t tell him of course because it s about all this superhuman crap which brings me to what the hell are you doing here you re mad oh j t see that s why i love you you always pick up on the tiniest detail i know i m sorry i m sorry look i m sorry i just i don t know how to juggle it all okay i am responsible for real case police case and i keep getting sidetracked by formaldehyde what i think i just narrowed down the list of lab for vincent we re trying to backtrack who infected all those innocent victim a few day ago to try to find who s behind the experiment not what i wa talking about but okay hold on are you using my security clearance to gain access to classified information well yeah that s why i m here i couldn t do it from my place certainly not with those thug breathing down my neck thug those are cop j t they re my cop would ve been nice if you told me you were coming here i could ve taken them off the clock saved myself a little grief well hopefully it ll all be over with soon gotta be one of these three lab you re not even listening to me huh come on a superhuman crazy is trying to kill cat and vincent and they need my help what am i supposed to do never mind te what cat and vincent are leaving why call heather maybe she know something julianna i see on your r sum you were working pr in the city heather pretty consistently yes and then you relocated to miami briefly and now you re

ringing i m focused and percent ready for this job sorry um you can see on my r sum that i assisted publicity for two of the largest firm on wall street i also cell phone ringing i am really sorry i don t know what s going on here um this is certainly not the norm really and are they part of the norm that no they re temporary my sister s a cop and she s sort of going through this thing and um cell phone beep i m sorry m chandler i ve heard good thing about you but i need someone who s a little le distracted cat it s your sister responding to your text message which aside from being rude because it wa a group text pretty much just cost me a job or wa it the goon who are shadowing me because someone s after you or maybe it wa j t and te calling to see if i knew why the hell you decided to bolt town without telling anyone first a if that would make me worry about you any le god i didn t even get a chance to pitch my totally cool throwback idea on mixing old hollywood and young hollywood pinups to help them sell their cosmetic line to both demographic but thanks to you i i m so sorry i wa just leaving wait that wa actually an interesting pitch the pinups idea why didn t you tell me that in the first place look like he s taking the bait man i it s me look like they re going to niagara fall i i it could be a trap should i still follow i i don t worry i ll bring them back alive i wait he s not trying to kill u i know might explain why we keep getting away from him catherine why would whoever s behind this want u back alive vincent i don t know but whatever the reason is i think he know it s a trap look maybe we should just head back right no he s still following u we stick to the plan at least we know he s after u and not our friend till death do u part right yeah till death do u part catherine he could be here already watching u waiting to make his move well hopefully he doe before we elope vincent what i don t have to like it do i we re not here to elope we re here to trap the guy who s chasing u protect our friend and family by eloping yes and even if we have to go through with the ceremony it doesn t have to count not if we don t file the marriage certificate afterwards are you completely sure about that you are such a romantic well i m trying to be woman i niagara fall marriage service hour are i okay let s say he doe fall for this ridiculous plan how do we capture the guy i m starting to think we don t have to what the more i think about it the more i think we should let him catch u that s what he want anyway right yeah what so we make him think that he succeeded something like that yeah and then what okay let s say he take u back to whoever sent him how do we get out of there we saw what he can do with bullet i hate to think what else he can do yeah but he hasn t seen what you can do yet for one reason or another every time that he s attacked you haven t been able to beast out so i say let him bring u back to whoever s behind this and then surprise okay you re banking a hell of a lot on thinking that they don t know that i am a beast we know that bob and carol didn t have a chance to tell them so how could they know next

lab behind all the experiment so what you can t pick up a phone and call me you would ve let me go to check out the lab by yourself no exactly te you don t understand this could be everything if this lab s what i think it is it can lead u right to whoever s behind it all look all i know is that i m risking my job to protect you and you and everybody else are just trying to get rid of your protection you don t think about how it reflects on me you don t understand this could be it we could be this close to solving all this superhuman crap and getting it out of all of our life once and for all that s not what i m talking about but that s all that matter right now look te don t worry i already figured out how to get around lab security so i can see what s really going on inside without cat and vincent yeah but just to check it out until they get back trust me te this is important i know what i m doing you know what j t this is important too and so is my job doesn t it matter to you at all of course it doe but i gotta do this for cat and vincent thanks for coming we didn t have much of a choice true okay you wanna tell u who you are my name is julianna but i m more interested in who you are and why you ve been trying to stop me that s what we do stop people like you you have no idea who i am that s why we let your friend here capture u to find out growling vincent how d you know that vincent s a beast truth is i should ve probably figured it out sooner luckily though my new assistant came through cat i m sorry cat my sister ha nothing to do with this please let her go you need to start answering my question catherine and tell me who you re really working for i already told you i work at the th i m a detective in the n y p d and vincent s just a doctor at new york general clearly what do you want me to say i want you to say how you were able to take down bob and carol hall and how you subdued zane alton and all my other enhanced test subject except for him he s a little more enhanced you know who vincent really is you know what he s capable of doesn t that answer your question it doesn t answer who sent you or how he found out where i am i don t know who you re talking about shout no no please stop please don t do this that s enough you re gonna tell me exactly where he s hiding i or we re gonna find out how much you re willing to see your fianc suffer i j t heather they might hear you what the hell is going on i don t know but they might kill them we have to do something what happened to you are you okay i don t know i ve never been beaten up before how did you know i wa here i didn t i just came to see if this wa the right lab but what are you doing here julianna tricked me i thought i got a new job but she forced me to talk i i didn t mean to say anything but they threatened to kill me and i didn t know what else to do what do you mean what did you say i told them about vincent about what he really is what did they do to him they shot him with the tranq gun before he could here she come put your hand behind your back like they re still tied door close julianna i if i m wrong i so what are we gonna do we gotta get vincent to wake up somehow beast out maybe find a little something to give him a boost you are running out of time i am running out of patience what is that the enhancement serum you re familiar with is the product of year of trial and error all to try and stop the man who sent you but this this is a failed attempt pushed the nervous system too far caused a painful overdose please don t i am telling you the truth in a city of million people you zeroed in on my test subject by chance i don t think so dhs knew about your experiment long before we did we were just helping them dhs hired a beast really yes they did what ll that do to him hopefully make him beast out kick some as what s in it a lot of thing epinephrine testosterone steroid it ll give vincent a hell of a jolt that s for sure we just need to find a delivery system will this help nice who are you talking about vincent vincent i m sorry i don t know what to do it s okay no it isn t you have to wake up you have to fight you have to do everything you can i can t lose you i love you no vincent last chance what are you waiting for shh we only get one shot at this please you have to believe me we are not working for anyone i don t know who you re talking about wrong answer growling grunting and shouting cat don t woman i dr moline to oncology dr moline to oncology please i how is she well she s she s in an induced coma until she can recover will she recover it s hard to say look catherine it s not your fault okay she wa gonna kill me and after everything she s put u through i know i know but there s supposed to be a difference between people like her and people like u i guess i just lost it well better you than me right do you believe what she wa saying that she did all this to stop somebody else i don t know i think that s more her problem than ours besides it s hard to believe that there is someone out there that s worse than her at least she won t be experimenting on innocent anymore whatever the reason well that s all we set out to stop when this first started right you guy okay can we get back to you on that yeah hey how long do you think we can keep her on the jail ward for hey you re the doctor you tell me okay if it s all right i d rather not admit her a a jane doe it s just kind of dicey with all the covering i ve done lately yeah i am so sorry te no no no don t apologize it is what it is and most importantly you caught the big bad well actually it wa your boyfriend who helped u out really yeah without j t and heather we wouldn t have made it vincent wouldn t be alive yeah well i m not surprised j t always come through for vincent no matter what hey no need to apologize and you can hold the congratulation it wa a team effort what s going on i really love this sweatshirt yeah i noticed that s hard to believe well you sleep in it almost every night and i love to see you in it it look good on you where are you going with this te talk to me look j t you saved the day you know you solved the grand mythological mystery it s just that you didn t give a rat s as about what i wa going through or what i needed i m sorry i no don t look te i admit i i wa preoccupied with finding the guy woman a it turn out behind it all but it wa worth it right i wa trying to help i wa trying to keep u safe and you did you did and i m grateful i really am you did a good thing so what s the problem i don t know i don t know what the problem is okay maybe it s because you ve been helping vincent for year maybe it s guilt because he s a beast or loyalty to him i don t know but all i know is that you re not loyal to me j t at least not emotionally and maybe it is it s selfish of me to want that and if it is so be it but i want to be with someone who put me first who care about what i need first and that s not you te i can t believe i almost lost you what s new yeah but this time it wa different julianna wa going to kill you and there wa nothing i could do but watch it happen but it didn t happen i just kept thinking about you dying u dying without ever getting a chance to get married well it s a good thing we didn t elope then right yeah it is my parent they didn t romanticize their wedding the way yours did oh well you know everybody s different you know doesn t mean they didn t love each other no i know and they did it wasn t until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding that i realized that i might want one do you yeah yeah i do especially after everything we ve been through to get here against all odds i don t want to lose you
